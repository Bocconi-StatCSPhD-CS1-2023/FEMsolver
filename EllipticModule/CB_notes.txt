* Good project
* Good report
* Module name EllipticPDE different from file name EllipticModule.jl
* using `sparse(zeros(N,N))` is not a great idea: it allocates a dense matrix of zeros and then throws it away immediately. Use `spzeros` instead.
* When your functions start having so many arguments, it is a sign that there is probably a cleaner way. Suggestion: group together arguments in structs, then pass around the whole struct as a single argument (remember to thoroughly annotate the struct attributes' types though). For example, it would seem convenient to create a `Mesh` type.
* When you start copy-pasting code, that's a hint that you should think of how to improve the design instead.
* Why keeping more columns than needed in the mesh files??
* Style notes: julia function names normally use underscores, not CamelCase, certainly not a mix of the two
